# higher_lower

Here I've created a replica of the Higher/Lower game from higherlowergame.com

User is supposed to guess which person/media has more followers. I created my own list of objects with made up follower counts.
As long as the user guesses correct, the score will increase and they can continue playing.
if incorrect, game over.

Enjoy!
